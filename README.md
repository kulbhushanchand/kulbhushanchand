### Hi there üëã
---

I am a PhD student at the [National Institute of Technology Jalandhar](https://www.nitj.ac.in/). I did my BTech and MTech in Electronics and Communication engineering. In PhD, my work is towards the development of a low-cost biofeedback system. My research interests lie in biofeedback systems, using video games for biofeedback, and gamification.

I am an avid supporter of **Open Source Technologies** and used them for most of my projects. My projects (including PhD work) are open source. I ‚ù§Ô∏è working on electronics hardware/software projects and learning new tools & technologies. When not working, I like running and cycling.
